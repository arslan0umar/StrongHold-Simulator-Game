## Features

### Core Systems

- **Army Management**: Train and maintain soldiers.
- **Economy**: Manage resources, taxes, and trade.
- **Diplomacy**: Form alliances, trade agreements, or declare wars.
- **Events**: Random events influence gameplay.

### Victory Conditions

- Eliminate other kingdoms through war or diplomacy.
- Maintain stability and growth of your kingdom.

### War Outcome System

* War results directly affect morale, leader popularity, and satisfaction.
* Victorious kingdoms gain reputation, while defeated kingdoms lose morale.

### Kingdom Elimination

* If a kingdom's population reaches zero, it is eliminated and removed from the map.
* Victory is declared when only one kingdom remains.

### Dynamic Market & Trade

* Market transactions recorded in `market_log.txt`.
* Prices and resources dynamically updated.

### Population & Events üè∞  
The game introduces a dynamic population system with **random events** that can positively or negatively impact the kingdom. Citizens are born over time, contributing to natural **population growth**, while **migration** brings in new people seeking better opportunities. At the same time, players must manage challenges like **deaths** caused by old age, disease, starvation, or unexpected events. These mechanics create a realistic cycle of growth and decline, making strategic resource management and decision-making essential for survival.
